This is a billow singlepage application that lists and filters members of an organization by skill.

A skill here is the main technology in a repository as determined by github.

This implementation has a couple of limitations due to it beeing my first singlepage app, my missing knowledge in the field of javascript and its tooling and time constraints.
Some limitations are:
* does not bother with github api pagination
* no auth support (so githubs request rate limiting will bite you)
* no tests
